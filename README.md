#The Travelling Reviewer Problem

Welcome to my submission for the Yelp Academic Dataset Challenge (Round 8).

For a quick introduction please have a look at my video: [Video Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBuvk87Bm70&feature=youtu.be)!

For a more detailed explanation, please refer to my working paper: [Write-Up](https://github.com/neum-juergen/TravellingReviewerProblem/blob/master/Master/Project-Write-Up.pdf)

Yelp Academic Dataset files need to be included into the "Master" folder before running the code. Microeconometric analyses are run with STATA SE 13 using the .do file in the "Master" folder.
